#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. - SE is all about writing code to computers, building apps that makes life easier and solves the world problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. - SE as a discipline, The rise of OOP, Agile and DevOps Revolution 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 

- Planning- In this initial phase, the project's scope, objectives, and feasibility are defined.
- Requirements Analysis - Stakeholders and project teams work together to gather and document what the software needs to accomplish.
- Design - Based on the requirements, developers create a blueprint for the system.
- Implementation - Developers translate the design into executable code.
- Testing - The software is rigorously evaluated to identify and correct defects.
- Deployment - Once the software passes testing, it is released to users.
- Maintenance - After deployment, the software is maintained and ongoing support is provided.
  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall follows a step-by-step process where each phase is completed before the next begins, while Agile divides the project into small iterations or sprints
- Waterfall Requirements are typically gathered upfront, best suited for projects where the scope is well-defined and unlikely to change, while Agile embraces change, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments throughout the development process
- Waterfall Extensive documentation is produced at every stage, while Agile prioritizes delivering functional software over comprehensive documentation.
- -- Waterfall is appropriate for projects that are well known and may not change, while Agile is suitable for projects that feedback and user requirements can change in the middle of the project.
  
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developers - responsible for writing, maintaining, and improving the codebase.
- QA Engineers - ensure that the software meets the required quality standards by testing for defects and verifying that all functionalities work as intended.
- Project Managers - oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of a project.
  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs and VCS are foundational tools in modern software development that enhance productivity, improve code quality, and facilitate collaboration among team members.
- IDEs provide a unified environment that streamlines the entire development process by integrating multiple tools into one application, while VCS are critical for managing changes to source code over time.
- Examples ( VCS - Git, Subversions(SVN), ( IDE - Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA)
  
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Complexity and Technical Debt - overcome by continuously improving code structure and eliminating redundant or obsolete parts.
- Ambiguous Requirements and Scope Creep - overcome by using iterative development and regular feedback cycles to adapt to changing requirements.
- Communication and Collaboration Barriers - Overcome by holding daily stand-ups or weekly syncs to align team efforts and address issues promptly.
- Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes - Overcome by dedicating time for professional development through online courses, certifications, and tech conferences.
  
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing - focuses on the smallest parts of the application.
- Integration testing - examines how different modules or units work together.
- System testing - evaluates the complete, integrated system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
- Acceptance testing - The final phase of testing, conducted by the end users or stakeholders, to confirm that the system meets business needs and is ready for production.
  
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions, or instructions in such a way that an AI model understands and responds in the most relevant, accurate, and useful manner possible.
- Importance - helps the model generate more focused and relevant answers, leads to faster and more efficient interactions, provide content that meets specific needs, help minimize common issues like AI hallucinations, helps tailor the AIâ€™s capabilities to solve specific problem.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague Prompt - "Tell me something interesting about AI."
- Improved Prompt- "Write a 200-word article on how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing modern healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment, and patient care."
